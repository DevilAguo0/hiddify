# SSH proxy setting on Hiddify panel

As you know, in version 8 of the Hidify panel, a proxy for the SSH service has been created, which does not have any access to the server and can only be used as a proxy. This proxy is completely secure and has no fingerprints for identification. (except the SSH protocol itself, which is in general use)
