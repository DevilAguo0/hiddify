## Add a profile to the app
In the user panel, go to the HiddifyN section again and `Click to import` so that the configurations are automatically added to the program.

One of the most important parts of this application is the proxy modes, which will be explained about each part below.

#### Auto/Smart
It will automatically connect to the configuration with the highest speed (lowest ping).

#### Load-Balance
It connects to several configs at the same time and traffic is distributed between them. This mode is very useful when you have several configurations with dirty IP, by spreading the load on several configurations at the same time, an acceptable speed is obtained.
