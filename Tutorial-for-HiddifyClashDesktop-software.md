# Tutorial for HiddifyClashDesktop software
This software is developed based on Clash and many features are included in it.

## Downloading the software
For this, enter the `Desktop` tab in your user panel and open the section related to `HiddifyClash`.



You can download the software based on your operating system from the section number 3 indicated in the image above.

## Installing the software

#### Windows
Installing the program is very simple and is completed with a few next steps.

#### Mac
For Mac, you must confirm the program in the privacy section.

#### Linux
For Linux, you only need to give executable access to the downloaded AppImage file and run it.


## Adding a profile to the app
For this, enter the `Desktop` tab in your user panel and open the section related to `HiddifyClash`.



- Here you need to get acquainted with a concept called profile. The profile of a yml file includes all the connections that can be accessed in this section. There are two types of profiles

- Green or lite profile for filtered sites, in which case only filtered sites are passed through the filter breaker and other sites, including Iranian sites, are opened without the filter breaker, which is a better mode. So you don't need to turn off VPN to open these sites.

- The second mode is the orange or normal profile, which sends all traffic from the filter breaker to the server. If Iranian sites are blocked on the server, they will not be opened, or if warp is enabled for all traffic, Iranian sites will be opened with warp.

- Finally, choose one of the two profiles.


## Profile
Click on install profile, the profile will be automatically added to the program. You can also import the copied link in the profile section manually in section 1.


In section number 2, the information related to the imported profile, including the expiration date and the total traffic volume and the traffic volume consumed, can be seen.

## Home
In this menu, you can turn the filter breaker on or off with the `Enable anti-censorship` button.


## Proxy
In this menu, you can specify how to run proxies (configs), which includes 3 main sections.


## Rule
This mode executes proxies based on the rules in the imported profile, which contains several sections.
