# Installation prerequisites

Before installation, you need a series of prerequisites:

- First, you need a virtual server. You can prepare the server in several ways.

  - You can get your virtual server directly from famous data centers in the world using credit card or other payment methods. [Here](https://github.com/hiddify/awesome-freedom/blob/main/vps-providers.md) we have collected a list of servers to visit.

  - You can also provide your own server using crypto currency. For this, just search on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=purchase+vps+using+crypto). There are many providers that support cryptocurrency. See our [list](https://github.com/hiddify/awesome-freedom/blob/main/vps-providers.md). Some of these data centers support cryptocurrencies that are specified in the list.

        

- The operating system of this virtual server must be Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04. Ubuntu is a distribution of Linux operating system whose logo is like this. ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu--E95420?style=flat-square&logo=ubuntu)
