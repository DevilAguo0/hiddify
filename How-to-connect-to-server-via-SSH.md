# How to connect to server via SSH
If for any reason access to the panel is not available through the web or your access is cut off and you do not have the emergency link; In this case, the only way to control and apply changes, as well as restore web access, is through the terminal.

In this case, you need to ssh to the server first.
for this job:
According to your operating system, open one of the following programs
- Windows: `PowerShell`
- Mac: `Terminal`
- Linux: `Terminal`

Then connect to the server by running the following command: `ssh user@<IP_Address>`

Usually, when you purchase a VPS you get the user ``root'' on the server. suppose your server's IP is 1.1.1.1, so the command is as follows:
```
ssh root@1.1.1.1
```
